1,"I can’t get over how good everything looks. Dr. Fate’s magic, Cyclone’s wind powers, Hawkman’s armor, and of course, Black Adam’s everything. Probably the most excited I’ve been for a DCEU movie in a long while.",2.6K,7 days ago,,
2,"Really hoping that this can save DC's movie universe. It's looking nice so far, casting seems great and tone feels appropriate. Can't wait to watch it.",814,7 days ago,,
3,U cant deny how good this looks.Now if they can just follow off of  this the rest of the movies going forward would be good.Like we need that great Superman movie!A great batman movie!A great Green Lantern movie,91,6 days ago,,

7,"I like a lot of the imagery and action, and it’s great to see the JSA (especially Doctor Fate), but it still feels weird to introduce Black Adam in anything other than a Shazam movie.",9,2 days ago,,
8,"Every time I watch this trailer, I get chills. I'm used to seeing The Rock as a comedian in his movie roles. But as Black Adam, he left me speechless. This movie is probably going to be one of 2022's movie highlights. I can't wait to see Black Adam when it releases in theaters next month!",47,4 days ago,,
9,"This movie feels like a step in the right direction for the DC Universe. A lot has gone wrong, but we see you guys constantly improving. Hopefully the movie is as good as the trailer! Marvel's on its descent, so someone will fill that void.",1,14 hours ago,,
10,Anguish and Rage are the two of most dangerous emotions to have when you’re human. Black Adam is that character that anyone can’t gravitate to because of his backstory. Pain is what makes you human but how you project that pain is what makes hero or villain. It’s up to us to decide who we are going to be in this world. That’s why Dr. Fate says you can the destroyer of this world or it’s savior well. It already has its savior. So that should play out for another movie “wink wink”,65,6 days ago,,
11,"I hope we get to see more of the Justice Society in this movie. I'm fine with a cameo or even a mention of guys like Wildcat, Dr. Midnite, Mr. Terrific, Stargirl or Alan Scott. lol Looks nice, though. It feels like Black Adam will be a full on anti-hero. He's had this change since the mid 2000s, so it's neat seeing it in a movie.",2.6K,9 days ago,,

15,This movie looks absolutely amazing I absolutely can not wait to see this in theatres,11,4 days ago,,
16,"This is going to be SO good. There had to have been at least four times during this trailer that I put my hands on my head to keep my mind from blowing. In the words of The Listener vocalist Dan Smith, ""I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.""",39,5 days ago,,
17,So looks like it’s going to be Black Adam Vs the JSA for the first two acts then Black Adam reluctantly helps them fight a bigger bad. They part ways at the end of the movie.,19,6 days ago,,
18,"Honestly, it's refreshing to see Dwayne playing a rather serious character in a big blockbuster. Usually he's confined to basically just playing a slightly altered version of himself, so seeing him fitting the tone of a movie with not a hint of comedy in any of its trailers is a nice surprise.",2.3K,9 days ago,,

29,"I feel like DC is finally starting to embrace its own identity. Zero jokes in the movie, no puns, no goofiness. Exactly how an anti-hero should be. Exactly the attitude I wanted to see from a man with absolute power who lost his son. Would be interesting to see how they incorporate this with the rest of the DCEU.
